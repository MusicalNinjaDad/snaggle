# Snaggle - snag the minimal files needed for a simple app container

Had enough of every container you pull having a full OS available inside? Create your own minimal app container easily by snaggling the binary and linked libraries.

```text
ninjacoder@f52ce3a5f188:/workspaces/snaggle/snaggle$ ./snaggle --help
Snag a copy of a binary and all its dependencies to DESTINATION/bin & DESTINATION/lib64

Snaggle is designed to help create minimal runtime containers from pre-existing installations.
It may work for other use cases and I'd be interested to hear about them at:
https://github.com/MusicalNinjaDad/snaggle

Usage:
  snaggle [--in-place] FILE DESTINATION
  snaggle [--in-place] [--recursive] DIRECTORY DESTINATION

Flags:
  -h, --help        help for snaggle
      --in-place    Snag in place: only snag dependencies & interpreter
  -r, --recursive   Recurse subdirectories & snag everything


In the form "snaggle FILE DESTINATION":
  FILE and all dependecies will be snagged to DESTINATION.
  An error will be returned if FILE is not a valid ELF binary.

In the form "snaggle DIRECTORY DESTINATION":
  All valid ELF binaries in DIRECTORY, and all their dependencies, will be snagged to DESTINATION.

Snaggle will hardlink (or copy, see notes):
- Executables              -> DESTINATION/bin
- Dynamic libraries (*.so) -> DESTINATION/lib64

Note:
- Hardlinks will be created if possible.
- A copy will be performed if hardlinking fails for one of the following reasons:
  - FILE/DIRECTORY & DESTINATION are on different filesystems
  - the user does not have permission to hardlink (e.g.
    https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/sysctl/fs.html#protected-hardlinks)
- Copies will retain the original filemode
- Copies will attempt to retain the original ownership, although this will likely fail if running as non-root

Exit Codes:
  0: Success
  1: Error
  2: Invalid command
  3: Panic
```

## Installing snaggle

### In a container (easiest)

  ```docker
  COPY --from=ghcr.io/musicalninjadad/snaggle /snaggle /bin/
  ```

### Download

> Grab the latest release binary (& SHA) from GitHub [`MusicalNinjaDad/snaggle/releases`](https://github.com/MusicalNinjaDad/snaggle/releases)

### Go install

> Install with `go install https://github.com/MusicalNinjaDad/snaggle@latest`

## Planned improvements

Future versions will:

- add heuristics to identify the best location for each file to make it easier to run snaggle to copy a library & dependencies
- provide a guaranteed error type from the snaggle library & make exit code handling more robust in the cli
- provide standard profiles for apps with non-linked dependencies such as SSL certs, locales, gconv etc.
- provide an option to copy an app & supporting libs & files which have been manually installed in /opt

## Why Go?

Historically this started as a python script, but I had to learn Go at some point - and this seemed like a good one. Plus it's much easier to `ADD` and use a single statically linked binary than a script and supporting interpreter.

That old python script is here in the git repo as v0.0.1 in case you're interested.
