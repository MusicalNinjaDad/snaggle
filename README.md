# Snaggle - snag the minimal files needed for a simple app container

Had enough of every container you pull having a full OS available inside? Create your own minimal app container easily by snaggling the binary and linked libraries.

## Why Go?

Historically this started as a python script, but I had to learn Go at some point - and this seemed like a good one. Plus it's much easier to `ADD` and use a single statically linked binary than a script and supporting interpreter.

That old python script is here in the git repo as v0.0.1 in case you're interested.
