## [v0.1.1] - fix release machinery

### Fixes

- removed attestations from automated release process

## [v0.1.0] - initial CLI (Go)

### Features

- CLI `snaggle FILE DESTINATION` to snag a copy of FILE and all its dependencies to DESTINATION/bin & DESTINATION/lib64
  - Hardlinks will be created if possible.
  - A copy will be performed if hardlinking fails for one of the following reasons:
    - path & root are on different filesystems
    - the user does not have permission to hardlink (e.g.
      https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/sysctl/fs.html#protected-hardlinks)
  - Copies will retain the original filemode
  - Copies will attempt to retain the original ownership, although this will likely fail if running as non-root
- Library `snaggle` providing same functionality
- Library `elf` with parsing functionality

## [v0.0.1] - python script

### Features

- Original script using lddwrap
